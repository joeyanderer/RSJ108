Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

              <h3><b>Avoid negative thinking.</h3>
              <p>Stop and count your blessings. Write down even the simplest things that you have and enjoy: a roof over your head, a bed to sleep on, quality food, warmth, security, good health, friends or family. Acknowledge that not everyone has these things. Use positive self-talk to encourage yourself.</p>

              <h3><b>Organize your life.</h3>
              <p>Set goals for what you need to achieve during the day, then write a to do list. Add some breathing room in the middle of the day that will give you time to recharge. Taking control of your time and priorities will significantly decrease the amount of stress you feel. Review your goals at the end of the day and look back on everything you achieved during the day.</p>

              <h3><b>Identify the things that put you under stress.</h3>
              <p>Make sure you understand why you become stressed so that you can try to avoid these circumstances. Knowledge is powerful, and self-knowledge is especially powerful. For example, let's say that you regularly get stressed at a certain time with a certain person then, go out of your way to prepare your brain for the upcoming stress.</p>

              <h3><b>Stop worrying about the things you cannot change.</h3>
              <p>This especially comes with things such as politics, and often applies to other individuals. Learning to accept things as they are is an important coping mechanism, but not as easy as it sounds.</p>

          <li>
            <div class="content">
              <h3><b>Take responsibility for making your life what you want it to be.</h3>
              <p>It is less stressful to make decisions and take action than to feel powerless and react to others' decisions. Decide what you want and go for it! Resist the urge to be perfect at all times. Perfectionism can cause huge amounts of stress if you hold yourself to unattainable standards. Be realistic about what you can and can't do. Don't set yourself up for failure just because you want to stroke your ego.</p>

              <h3><b>Develop a sense of humor.</h3>
              <p>One of the barriers to stress reduction is the temptation to take things too seriously. It's okay to back off from your intensity and see the humour in life's situations. Laugh a little or better yet, laugh a lot! See the humour in stress. Learn to laugh at yourself. Don't put yourself down, or lash your self-esteem, but try to be playfully deprecating about yourself from time to time.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <h3><b>Learn to lean on friends and loved ones.</h3>
              <p>This is one of the most important things, as keeping things bottled up can only cause more stress. Your friends, if they are true friends, will try to understand what you're going through, and will accompany that empathy with a sincere desire to help out if at all possible.</p>
